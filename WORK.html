		Where I Work
		</h1>
		<p>
		The one thing I do more than building cars is working. Buying and building old trucks and fast cars takes alot of income, especially while paying tuition. My main source of employment isan IT Consultant Company based in the mid-coast named EES Consulting. We provide IT support and security for many businesses in the surounding area. I started this job as an internship my sophomore year of highschool because I was tired of making pizzas and minimum wage. This job is where I have learned most of my technologies skills and business knowledge. Over the years i've become quite well versed in the different sides of IT from System Administration work with servers and firewalls, to fire and security system installs. The most important thing I've taken away from it is my understanding of how businesses work and run efficiently. Last year I also started my position at the Advanced Structures and Composites Center here on Campus, in the IT department. Though I've done a lot of work with computers, my ultimate goal is not to be a tech forever, I enjoy the managerial and business side of companies more.
