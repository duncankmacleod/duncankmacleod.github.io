		My Hobby
		</h1>
		<p>
		In my free time I love to work on cars and trucks. Perferably, I like japanese cars, i.e. Honda, Nissan, and classic American trucks. Over the years I've built many trucks from the ground up, starting with rusty, condemed vehicles I find in peoples back yards that practically give them away and make them driveable again. For instance, the black Dodge Power-Ram you see here was heading to the scrap yard when I bought it. Though it looks rough on the outside, you can see the pictures of the frame after it's restoration is imaculate. The overall goal is to make the trucks reliable. This Dodge makes a trip to and from Boston every weekend throughout the school year as my friend drives it back and forth to Boston University. When you tell someone that they usually don't believe you, as that's a lot of wear and tear for any vehicle let alone a 27 year old truck, but thats the best part to me. Drivability and comfort is also important so I always make sure steering components are upgraded and a/c is installed if possible, along with power locks, windows and mirrors. My philosophy on it is if you put $5,000-$8,000 into an old vehicle and do it correctly, it will be just as reliable as a comparativley priced modern vehicle. As for cars, I'm a big fan of Honda and Nissan. The cars I buy are not intended to be big projects like the trucks, instead they are just tuners and comfortable drivers. I think the handling of a car is just as important as how quick it is and I find Honda s2000's and Nissan 350z's to be in the perfect balance.
