		Where I Go To School
		</h1>
		<p>
		I am a student at the University of Maine in Orono. Currently, I am working on my sophomore year and plan to graduate in the spring of 2020. Since starting my college career, I have met many great friends and had some awesome experiences. I like the feel of the campus here in Orono and the oprotunities availible here.
